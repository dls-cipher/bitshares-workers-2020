BitShares Core Team Members, Roles and Budgeted Effort
======================================================
BitShares Core Team constitutes a small, dedicated, and seasoned group of professionals.  These are highly-skilled engineers, some with doctorate level education in the programming and logic design industry.  As such, they are prized assets of the BitShares community who should be retained.   Understanding the aforementioned devalued state of the chain, these committed members of the BitShares community are prepared to accept substantially lower hourly rates than previously contracted.

**Hardcap definition:**
This Worker reintroduces payouts in BTS, instead of fiat equivalent BitAssets. As such, in the case of appreciation in value of the BTS token over time, this worker will cap employee pay at the value of 0.04 USD per 1 BTS token. The worker begins at lower core rate for hours in concessions to the depreciation of the BTS token value.  BTS payouts are considered fixed (per table 1) as long as the price is <0.04 USD per 1 BTS token. In case of the price >0.04 USD, amount of BTS used for payout will be capped such that:  Maximum USD = BTS fixed rates defined in this worker * 0.04.  

Terms of Worker/Agreement
==================

1) Team hour reports and code audit will be done once every 3 weeks. A single collective team invoice will be issued by the Worker Manager (Milos Preocanin) with previous approval by the Audit Manager (Abit More).

2) This worker max budget is calculated by the max amount of hours available by each team member. All unspent BTS core token will be returned to the reserves.

3) Milos Preocanin will be held as the principal responsible contact for this worker, on behalf of “Zavod Premik”.

4) This worker's agreement is crafted as a quick and urgent mini project with pre-defined estimates.

5) This worker budget has calculated 3% escrow fees.
