For the period from October 2017 until January 2020, BitShares Blockchain Foundation - non-profit based in The Netherlands was

# More details on current legal issue(s)

Due to cancellation terms of legal worker for 2020 by BitShares Blockchain Foundation and expiry of period for Community to publicly express opinion/vote on it, there is possibility that all agreements/proceedings will be void by previous legal representative. 

As Community has no knowledge on amount or value of documentation and potential damage for the blockchain, Acting CEO of Move Institute (Milos Preocanin) reached BitShares Blockchain Foundation on Friday (31. January), via bitsharestalk.org making a request for extension on behalf of few holders. 
This message was relayed during working hours in Holland. Followed by written email on Monday, 3. February, with inquiry on potential cost, willingess and time on behalf of BitShares Blockchain and Community (still waiting reply).

In order to prepare Community for potential scale of the process, these are our findings and can be possible agreement done
or contacts established on behalf of BitShares Blockchain:
